		<h2>Informed Consent</h2>

		<h4>All exercises and workshop activities are designed to enable
			students to experience different levels of intensity and duration of
			activities. As a result, some individuals may experience different

			take part in activities that are either new to them or they are less
			familiar with.</h4>
		<h4>Each workshop activity is designed to be safe and effective
			and to minimise any risk of injury.</h4>
		<h4>If you feel any pain or discomfort at any time, stop doing
			the activity concerned and inform the Instructor. If you have any
			reason that you believe means that you should not perform any of the
			activities you are asked to do; do not perform that activity and
			inform the Instructor of your decision and the reasons.</h4>
		<h4>The training program has been explained to me and I am
			willing to take part.</h4>
		<h4>Of course, I understand that I may withdraw my participation
			at any time.</h4>
