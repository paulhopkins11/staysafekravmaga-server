		<h2>Informed Consent</h2>

		<h4>All exercises and workshop activities are designed to enable

			familiar with.</h4>
		<h4>Each workshop activity is designed to be safe and effective
			and to minimise any risk of injury.</h4>
		<h4>If you feel any pain or discomfort at any time, stop doing
			the activity concerned and inform the Instructor. If you have any
			reason that you believe means that you should not perform any of the
			activities you are asked to do; do not perform that activity and
			inform the Instructor of your decision and the reasons.</h4>

			willing to take part.</h4>
